# A Full Stack Developer’s Journey

## Description:
###### As a student in MiT’s Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN, August 2022 cohort, I created this website as a place to chronicle my coding skill development. This website shows my progress via completing and adapting exercises in the MiT program. Also, it includes a resources page in which I’ve added links and code snippets from other sources that have specifically helped me to solve these exercises. The site includes a technical journal that offers reflections on my process. This website is a work in progress that I will continually add content to from August 2002 – July 2023.

## Sources:
###### MiT faculty members Dr. Abel Sanchez and Dr. John Williams provided video instructional content for the course. Coding exercises for this project used NextTech software, and solution code was provided for many exercises.
###### Readers will notice in my comments how I attempted to solve each exercise without the solution code first. When I resort to using solution code, I note in my comments where my gaps in understanding were and the resources that I used to solve problems.
###### My first objective with the MiT exercises was to complete missing sections of instructional code and get the code to pass the NextTech automatic grader. My second objective was to go beyond what the exercises instructed me to do and to expand upon the code to modify its appearance and functionality.

## Installation:
###### The website does not need to be installed; it runs on a browser. Individual JavaScript exercises execute immediately after opening their corresponding html index files.

## Usage:
###### The webpage automatically runs as soon as the index.html is opened. Users can navigate the site by clicking on the hyperlinks. All external links open in a separate browser window.

## Support:
###### There is no support for this page.

## Roadmap:
###### I will further develop this project as I work through the course until July 2023. Specifically, I will add course content, resources, and modify its design.
