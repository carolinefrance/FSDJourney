    <p>The purpose of this page is to show what programmers can do with HTML alone. I purposely did NOT use CSS or JavaScript on this page.</p>

<p>I write most of my html in the VS Code editor, and the shortcut to automatically enter the html basic tags is <strong>(Ctrl+Shift+X)</strong> and type <strong>html</strong>.<br>Note to self: this text is enclosed in paragraph tags:
    < p>. I don't have to add a break tag:
        < br> after paragraphs or headings because the next line of text automatically starts at the line below.</p>

<h3>Image Considerations</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Although it is best practice to size images in a program like PhotoShop, image attributes "width" and "height" can be used to modify the size of any image. If I were using CSS, I could set more flexible dimensions to fill differently sized screens
        (more on that later). </li>
    <li>I used a <b>relative URL</b> (which has a shorter path than the full link's absolute URL).</li>
    <li>When I type the name of an image in quotation marks to call the file, I cannot type the file name alone if the html file and image file are not in the same folder (which they usually are not). Instead, I must give the folder (a.k.a. directory) in
        which the image is located followed by a forward slash.</li>
    <li>In this case, both my html and image files are located in the same directory, but I created an <b>images subfolder</b>, in which I can place future images. Therefore, I wrote: img src="images/CjFrance.jpeg" for the html document to find the image.</li>
    <li>Also, I added an "<b>alt</b>" attribute to add text to describe the image. This is because the image might not show up, or a person could use a screen reader to hear what is in the image. Side note: in the future, I will create a specific folder for
        each site created to better organize my files.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's a helpful link to a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_attributes.asp">list of html attributes</a>. Remember, attributes are like optional fillings inside of a sub sandwich, things like alignment, size, and bacon.
    <br>Spoiler: many future attributes will be created and managed with CSS. </p>
<p>Below is an ordered list of what otherwise naked heading tags look like:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <h1>h1</h1>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>h2</h2>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>h3</h3>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>h4</h4>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>h5</h5>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h6>h6</h6>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>I know... it's unsettling. :-)</p>
<p>In addition to setting the default language to English in the
    < html lang="en"> tag, below are some paragraphs that use the language attribute to use additional languages on a webpage. I positioned the content in an old-school, centered table with two rows, three cells across, with text aligned center.</p>
<p align="center"> Here 's a helpful link that
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp">lists abbreviations for languages</a>.</p>
<table align="center" ;="" width="100%">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td width="33%" ;="" align="center">
                <b>Mandarin Chinese, 6 yrs.</b></td>
            <td width="33% " ;="" align="center">
                <b>French, 3 yrs.</b>
            </td>
            <td width="33% " ;="" align="center">
                <b>Spanish, 1 yr.</b>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td width="33% " ; align="center">
                <p lang="zh-Hans ">我 &nbsp; 学了 &nbsp; 六 &nbsp; 年 &nbsp; 普通话。<br>Wǒ xuéle liù nián pǔtōnghuà.</p>
            </td>
            <td width="33% " ; align="center">
                <p lang="fr ">J'ai étudié trois ans de français.</p>
            </td>
            <td width="33% " ; align="center">
                <p lang="es ">Estudié tres semestres de español.</p>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>Note, if you write Chinese characters and want to separate words, hitting the space bar will not work.
    <br>However, ye olde nonbreaking space (&amp; + nbsp + ;) still works in this circumstance.</p>


<p align="center">Next, here's an example of an audio file and player:</p>

<p align="center">To hear me read Emily Dickinson's short poem “Hope Is the Thing with Feathers"
    <br>Click on the play button below (31 seconds).</p>
<table align="center" ;="" width="100%">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td align="center">
                <audio controls="">
                    <source src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carolinefrance/FSDJourney/AUDIOHopeIsTheThingWithFeathers.m4a" type="audio/mpeg">
                    Your browser does not support the audio element.
                </audio>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p align="center">Note to self: for the audio player, the center align attribute does not work; my HTML workaround was to place the player in a table with a center aligned "td."</p><br><br>

<td width="5%"></td>
