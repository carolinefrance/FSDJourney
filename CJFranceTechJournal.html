            <p>TASKS, MODULE 2: (1) Create website, (2) NextTech Mod. 2 Exercises, (3) VS Code quirks, (4) Learn JavaScript, (5) JS Ball Challenge, (6) Screencast</p>
            <p>PROCESS:<br>
                <ol>
                    <li>I continually added content to the FSD Journey website that I created this week. I researched CSS grid, background-image properties, RGBA color (transparent effect), and how to use multiple anchor styles for different divs that were
                        on the same page. It was tricky to get the background-image to fill differently sized screens when using CSS grid, and it 's still not perfect.</li>
                    <li>I coded along with MiT videos. I pasted code I wrote in the Google Docs folder I created for this site. I'm keeping track of code that works and writing a lot of comments to explain what I 'm doing for future reference. In NextTech,
                        sometimes the instructions are incorrect, there are typos, and the code sometimes doesn't pass if I use a <b>let</b> instead of a <b>var</b> to declare variables. The NextTech feels like having to take a test that I wasn't given
                        information to study for, so I spend hours searching for solutions. When I find a bug and a solution for it, I share what I learned with classmates on <b>Slack</b>.</li>
                    <li>VS Code has <b>spacing issues</b>. Specifically, it doesn't allow me to break a line when I want to, and it adds a space to the left of closing quotation marks. This is really problematic, because with the extra space, the div won
                        't behave as designed. Now, before committing a file, I always do an Edit/Replace to strip the whitespace to the left of a closing quote.</li>
                    <li>Although I can successfully write independent expressions and statements (that I mostly learned on Codecademy and W3Schools, sometimes MDN), I struggle to make these work together and to apply static example code to the needs of my
                        project. I need to devote much more time on Codecademy tutorials to better understand what I'm doing in JavaScript, as I 've found their hands-on, step-by-step exercises to be my favorite study method so far. I'm also taking notes
                        on Codecademy.<br></li>
                    <li>For the JS ball challenge, I integrated more CSS, modified the grid template, changed the positioning of the JS execution, created seven balls, and assigned different movements to different balls. The things that are still not working
                        are that I want to use the setTimeout method to consecutively show balls independently. I want to write a function that makes the balls change from a min size 50 px to a max size 100 px, to make the balls look like they're pulsing.
                        Also, I need to tweak the return statement, because the moveBall function is only executing once.</li>
                    <li>There has to be a better way to do a screencast than through Zoom. I filmed, edited out pauses/mistakes, and uploaded my JSBallCallenge video to my YouTube page.</li>
                </ol>
